# Welcome, This is Light Stick Lux Flux Project

---
## What is Lux Flux? It is an interactive juggling prop sticks that has the following features:

* Audio Rhythmic Light: For each sound peak, it can change to a different color, with up to 10 configurable color sequences.
* Motion Sensitivity: The light stick can change color when moving in clockwise or anticlockwise directions. There is also a movement gesture to turn off lights.
* Programmable Light Sequences: Light sequences can be programmed from an external andorid app or PC.
* Wi-Fi Syncing: LED sticks can be synced with Wi-Fi, so there is only a need to program one LED stick and the other one will have the same color sequence.
